## Install and Verify Cloud Foundry CLI

1. If you haven't already done so, download the latest release of the [Cloud Foundry CLI](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/releases) for your operating system and install it.

   It's easiest to use the installers.

1. From a command prompt, set the Cloud Foundry target for the CLI.

   Note: Ask your instructor for the appropriate URL for your workshop environment.

   ```bash
   > cf api https://api.run.haas-76.pez.pivotal.io --skip-ssl-validation
   ```

1. Login to Cloud Foundry by following the prompts.

   Note: Use the (student-X) username and password assigned to you by your instructor.

   ```bash
   > cf login
   API endpoint: https://api.run.haas-76.pez.pivotal.io

   Email> student-1

   Password>
   Authenticating...
   OK

   Targeted org student-1

   Targeted space development

   API endpoint:   https://api.run.haas-76.pez.pivotal.io (API version: 2.54.0)
   User:           student-1
   Org:            student-1
   Space:          development

   ```

## Access Pivotal Cloud Foundry Apps Manager

1. Login to the Pivotal Apps Manager. (e.g. <https://apps.run.haas-76.pez.pivotal.io>)

   Note: Ask your instructor for the appropriate URL for your workshop environment.

   Note: Use the same username and password you entered when logging in using the Cloud Foundry CLI above.
